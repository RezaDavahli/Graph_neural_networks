# Graph_neural_networks
This repository is about using Graph neural networks (GNN) for predicting dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.

A package for calculating Effective Reproductive Numbers (Rt) is represented.

Files are including as follows:
1- Selecting graph for GNN: either connectivity_network_graph or neighborhood_graph files
2- Time series of effective reproductive numbers(Rt): R_fifty_states
3- Calculating Rt based on COVID-19 confirmed cases in all states: EpiEstim
4- The results of using connectivity network: matrix of connectivity among states
5- Running the code based on Pytorch:Run.py
